# JavaScript GameBoy Color Emulator

**Copyright (C) 2010 - 2016 Grant Galitz**

Basically just a GUI edit to remove all options except `mute` and `reset`.
Good if you don't want users to be able to select their own ROM files.

If you end up using this be sure to compilate the `.ts` files in the `js` folder.
